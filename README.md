I'm drawn to places where form meets function. And I love the idea of using technical skills to create beautiful things. I started tying decorative knots in 2015 and quickly fell in love. Here is where I put the things I've learned about knots in the hope that it helps others. Happy tying!

## Conventions

As a technical writer, I know the importance of using words accurately. And this sometimes goes against my number one goal which is to communicate effectively. For example, there is a difference between a knot and an interweave. When the difference matters, I'm specific. All other times I follow these conventions: 

* I use **knots** to mean both knots and interweaves. 
* I use **bights** and **parts** (not bights and leads). 
* I always list bights first. It's easier to group knots this way, both for me and the computer. 
* I use **strands** to mean both strands and passes.
