I'm drawn to places where form meets function. And I love the idea of using technical skills to create beautiful things. I started tying decorative knots in 2015 and quickly fell in love. Currently, this is an 'encyclopedia' of my knotting adventures. The ultimate goal is to have a living resource center fueled by contributors.
