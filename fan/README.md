# Cylindrical Fan Knots & Interweaves

This topic introduces fan knots & interweaves as a way to explore column & row coding, over-under patterns, shifted bights, and locked bights. The common patterns used are Gaucho, Herringbone, and Pineapple.

These knots start with a THK and continue with a specific pattern. Read [Turk's Head Knots]() before reading this. 



## Over-Under Pattern
