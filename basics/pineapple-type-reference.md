# Pineapple Knot Type Reference

A few years ago, [John Allwine](https://www.facebook.com/freakinsweetknots/) – creator of [Advanced Grid Maker](http://freakinsweetapps.com/knots/knotgrid/advanced.html) – was generous enough to help me learn about the pineapple interweave. Before you can use a tool like AGM, you need to decide how many strands or colors the knot will have and the ‘type’ of pineapple you want to tie. Here’s a quick reference for 2, 3, and 4 strand pineapple types.

## The Big Idea

A Pineapple Knot (PK) is two or more Turk's Head knots interwoven following a specific pattern. The **'type'** of pineapple refers its number of EQALLY SIZED and STACKED Turk's Head knots. These equally sized knots may or may not surround other, smaller Turk's Head knots. 

In the images below, the order of the colors is the same - which highlights how the type is what determines the final look of the knot. 

An idea not shown in the images below is that you can describe a PK as one type surrounding another type. For example, a 5-strand type II has two equally sized TKs surrounding three smaller knots. But how are those three arranged? 

## 2-Strand Pineapple Knots

### Type I: Black is ONE LARGE knot surrounding the smaller red knot.

### Type II: Black and red are TWO EQUALLY SIZED and STACKED knots.

## 3-Strand Pineapple Knots
