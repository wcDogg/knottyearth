# AGM: Pineapple Knots

How to use Advanced Grid Maker to generate instructions & images for Pineapple knots. 

## Recipes Available!

I can't lie, Pineapples are kind of tricky in AGM. Originally, I created [this Google Sheet]() to capture all the settings needed for 2, 3, and 4 strand knots. 

The remainder of this topic explains how to plug in values from this sheet. But it's such a huge pain, I decided to go ahead and create a cookbook. Each recipe has: 

* A reference image of the knot.
* A screenshot of the AGM settings. 
* Knot instructions in Dotted format.
* Knot instructions in consolidated format. 
* The AGM `Save/Load Knot Data`.
