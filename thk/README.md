# Turk's Head Knot

The Turk's Head Knot (THK) is one of first decorative knots new tyers learn - it's beautiful, functional, and the foundation for interweaves including: Pineapple, Herringbone, Gaucho Fan, and custom designs.

The THK is a single-strand, closed-loop knot - its standing & working ends meet to form a 'loop'. 

The THK is a cylindrical braid - it can be tied directly around an object. More specifically, THKs can be tied on objects with no open end - like railings and wheels. They can also be worked into flat and bowl-like shapes. 

THKs are column coded. The pattern for a THK is over-1, under-1 - or OU.
