# Knot Theory

Knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. Knot theory is used in encryption, genetics, quantum physics, and lots of other fields. 

[Youâ€™ve heard of string theory. What about knot theory?](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160210170411.htm)

## What is a Knot?

* A **real-world knot** has open ends - think of tying your shoelace. 
* A **mathematical knot** is the smooth embedding of a circle into 3-dimensional space - its ends are joined. 
* The simplest mathematical knot is the circle.

Mathematical knots cannot be unknotted (returned to a circle) without cutting - and there are an infinite number of them. Imagine joining the standing and working ends of a completed THK. No amount of manipulation can deconstruct the THK into a circle - the only option is to cut and unweave from one end. 

While a real-world Turk's Head is tied with open ends, joining the ends does create a mathematical knot - so we can use knot theory to describe it. 

A knot can be represented in multiple ways and it can be deformed into other shapes. Again, think of a Turk's Head around a sphere vs hourglass. This makes it especially hard to identify equivalent knots. 

## Hard Questions, Ongoing Answers

The two most relevant questions in knot theory are also the hardest. Given a diagram or some other representation: 

* How can we tell if a knot can be unknotted without cutting? 
* How can we tell if two knots are the same? What knot properties are used to describe equivalency? 

It's crazy to learn how unresolved these questions are. If this kind of thing interests you, check out the video: [The Mathematics of Knots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4WA3-tZgcc).
