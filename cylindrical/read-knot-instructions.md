# How to Read Knot Instructions

I'm a person who needs exact instructions to tie any knot. When I first started, I had a hard time understanding how to read the different types of instructions I came across. I kept struggling until one day I committed to figuring out how it works. 

I did it using a 7L 6B Turk's Head tied on a mandrel. I followed a video to tie the knot and compared each step to 3 different types of instructions. And I just kept looking until I got it. 

It's not as hard as I thought it would be, and it let me start doing more complex knots. What follows is everything you need to try the same exercise - happy tying!
