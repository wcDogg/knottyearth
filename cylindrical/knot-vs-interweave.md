## Knot vs Interweave 

The mathematical definition of a knot is: the smooth embedding of a circle into 3-dimensional space. In lay-speak, if you join the standing & working ends of a knot, you have a single, closed loop. The loop is described as a path following a pattern of overs and unders.

Technically, a single-strand **knot** tied with multiple **passes** is different than an **interweave** tied with multiple **strands**. 

This distinction is mostly academic. Mathematically, a 1-strand knot with 2 passes is the same as a 2-strand interweave - it has the same number of bights, parts, columns, rows, crossings, and facets. The only difference between a knot and interweave is if the pattern is completed as a single path or as multiple paths. 

Functionally, the choice to use multiple strands will come down to 3 things:

* You want to use multiple colors.
* You prefer tying with multiple, shorter strands.
* You only have shorter strands. 

## Doubling & Tripling

When you 'double' or 'triple' a knot, you are following an existing path & pattern additional times. Mathematically, the knot is unchanged - it has the same number of bights, parts, and so on. 

This is different from making 'passes' which have their own paths. And its different from an 'interweave' where each strand builds the pattern. Passes, paths, and patterns are inherent to the math - changes to these do change bights, parts, and so on. 

## Convention

For consistency, I use 'knot' and 'strands'. I recognize this isn't the correct pairing - it's what I learned first and it stuck. I can't seem to un-stick it - probably because I don't think anyone is confused by it. 

## Example

This is a Gaucho Fan Knot - it's tied with 1 strand that makes 3 passes.

This is a Gaucho Fan interweave - it's tied with 3 strands that make 1 pass each.
