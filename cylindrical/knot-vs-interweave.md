## Knot vs Interweave 

* A **real-world knot** has open ends. 
* A **mathematical knot** is a single, continuous loop - it has closed ends.
* If you can take a form's real-world working & standing ends and join them to make a single loop, then the rules of [mathematical knots](../general/knot-theory.md) apply.

## No Real Difference for Tying

Technically, a single-strand **knot** tied with multiple **passes** is different than an **interweave** tied with multiple **strands**. 

For tyers, the distinction is mostly academic. Mathematically, a 1-strand knot with 2 passes is the same as a 2-strand interweave of the same pattern - it has the same number of bights, parts, columns, rows, crossings, and facets. 

The only difference between a knot and interweave is if the pattern is completed as a single path or as multiple paths. 

Functionally, the choice to use multiple strands will come down to 3 things:

* You want to use multiple colors.
* You prefer tying with multiple, shorter strands.
* You only have shorter strands. 

Stated another way, an interweave is a series of what are called **linked knots** - you could join the working and standing ends of all strands in a way that does form a single loop. 

## Doubling & Tripling

When you 'double' or 'triple' a knot, you are following an existing path & pattern additional times. Mathematically, the knot is unchanged - it has the same number of bights, parts, and so on. 

Doubling and tripling are different than making passes - a pass has its own path that's needed to complete the knot or interweave. Passes, paths, and patterns are inherent to the math - changes to these do change bights, parts, and so on. 

## Example

This is a Gaucho Fan Knot - it's tied with 1 strand that makes 3 passes.

This is a Gaucho Fan interweave - it's tied with 3 strands that make 1 pass each.
