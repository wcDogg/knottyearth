# Knot vs Interweave 

A **knot** is a single strand that has a path and pattern. The path may make multiple passes to complete the pattern - i.e. a 3-pass Gaucho Fan Knot.

When I say **interweave** I usually mean a multi-pass knot, tied with multiple strands, where each strand replaces one of the passes - i.e. a 3-strand Gaucho Fan Interweave.

The interweave above is a series of **linked knots**. Each strand is a THK and the working & standing ends of all 3 could be joined to form a single, continuous loop. I like the idea of linked knots because it can describe custom designs and patterns that don't have a name. 

## No Major Difference

For tyers, the distinction is mostly academic. A 1-strand knot with 3 passes is almost identical to a 3-strand interweave. They use the same pattern and have the same number of bights, parts, crossings, and facets. 

The only difference between a knot and interweave is if the pattern is completed as a single path or as multiple paths. Functionally, the choice to use multiple strands will come down to 3 things:

* You want to use multiple colors.
* You prefer tying with multiple, shorter strands.
* You only have shorter strands. 

## Doubling & Tripling

When you 'double' or 'triple' a knot, you are following an existing path & pattern additional times. Mathematically, the knot is unchanged - it has the same number of bights, parts, and so on. 

Doubling and tripling are different than making passes - a pass has its own path that's needed to complete the knot or interweave. Passes, paths, and patterns are inherent to the math - changes to these do change bights, parts, and so on.
