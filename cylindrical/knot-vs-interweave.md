## Knot vs Interweave 

Strictly speaking, a **knot** is a single strand with a single path & pattern. In the case of Fan and Pineapple Knots, the path makes 2 or more **passes**. 

An **interweave** is a pattern tied with two or more **strands**. Each strand has its own pattern & path. 

This distinction is mostly academic. Mathematically, a 1-strand knot with 2 passes is the same as a 2-strand interweave - it has the same pattern and the same number of bights, parts, columns, rows, crossings, and facets. The only difference is 1 path vs multiple paths. 

Functionally, the choice to use multiple strands will come down to 3 things:

* You want to use multiple colors.
* You prefer tying with multiple, shorter strands.
* You only have shorter strands. 

## Doubling & Tripling

When you 'double' or 'triple' a knot, you are following an existing path & pattern additional times. Mathematically, the knot is unchanged - it has the same number of bights, parts, and so on. 

This is different from making 'passes' which have their own path. And its different from an 'interweave' where each pass builds the pattern. Passes, paths, and patterns are inherent to the math - changes to these do change bights, parts, and so on. 

## Convention

For consistency, I use 'knot' and 'passes'. At least, I try - the occasional 'strand' will slip in. And that's okay because you'll know what I mean :)

## Example

This is a Gaucho Fan Knot - it's tied with 1 strand that makes 3 passes.

This is a Gaucho Fan interweave - it's tied with 3 strands that make 1 pass each.
