# Cylindrical Knot Basics

One way to become a better tyer is to learn how knots are described. This section covers the properties shared by cylindrical knots & interweaves. It includes Turk's Head, Pineapple, and Fan (Gaucho, Herringbone) as examples. 

Knots are technical, mathematical things. While I'm fascinated by that and am actively learning, this section aims for a practical understanding - the explanations are brief and there's lots of images to study. 

And study you must. Keep tying, keep looking, and things come together :)
