# Column Coding & Row Coding

A knot is ether column coded or row coded. The size of a cylindrical knot can be described as having some number columns & rows. 

Row and column coding are at the heart of a knot's structure. I haven't fully internalized the concepts. What follows are visual examples and layperson's way of recognizing which is being used - I hope they help :)

## Column Coding

This is a 3-strand Fan with column coding - often called Herringbone. The triangles are pointing up. The triangle bases are horizontal and span columns.

## Row Coding

This is a 3-strand Fan with row coding - often called Gaucho. The triangles are pointing to the right. The triangle bases are vertical and span rows.

## How to Count Columns

For Fan Knots, columns = bights * 2. The math is a little different for Pineapples & other knots with nested & shifted bights. This knot has 9 bights and 18 columns.

## How to Count Rows

For Fan Knots, rows = parts + 1. Again, the math is a little different for Pineapples & other knots with nested & shifted bights. This knot has 15 parts and 16 rows.

## Look Close

This is just something I find interesting - it's a study in the similarities and differences between row & column coding.

The knot on the left is row coded. The knot on the right is column coded, rotated 90 degrees CV, and flipped vertically. They're very similar - if tied with a single strand, they'd be hard to tell apart. But by adding color and expanding the gaps, we see the paths are different.

The 3-strand knots below uses a simple OU pattern. The left is row coded and the right is column coded. Even without rotating or flipping, they are similar. Again, tied with a single strand they'd be difficult to distinguish and it's the color & gaps that highlight the different paths.
